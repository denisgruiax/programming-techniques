## About the project. 🪴
### Purpose. 🎯
The purpose of this programs is to test the ability to solve problems that consist in the basics of working with: 📚
```sh
- Getting familiar with Linux. Command line parameters
- Unions. Enumerations. Structures with bit fields
- Complex statements. Pointers to functions
- Text Files. Writing. Reading
- Binary files. Writing. Reading
- The C Preprocessor Definitions and Macros. Applications of macros
- Compile yourself. Testing. Troubleshooting. Contract. Assertions
- Functions with variable number of arguments
- Analysis of algorithms. Simply linked lists
- Doubly linked lists. Abstract data types
- Independent compilation
- Greedy. Divide and conquer
- Backtracking
```

### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with C or C++ compilers.

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Windows, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL)
- Programming Language: C
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 

I used WSL as operating system, VSCode as code editor and to compile the code i made use of gcc compiler.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install c/c++
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. Compile from command line
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall app.c -o app
   ```
   
3. VSCode C/C++ extesion pack
   ```sh
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)
   ```
   
4. Configure VSCode to run and debug C/C++ programs inside VSCode under WSL.
   ```sh
   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl
   ```
